# TicTacToe
TicTacToe is a simple and classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to align three of your symbols (either X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does. The game alternates turns between players until one wins or all grid spaces are filled, resulting in a draw.
